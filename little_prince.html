        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 

        <span id = "first_underline"> 
        <!-- underline-->
        I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span>

        <span id = "hl_o"> 
        <!-- highlight orange -->
        It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span>

        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: 

        <span id = "b_r">
        <!-- bold and red-->
        "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù </span>


        <!-- regular -->
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 

        <span id = "b_r2"> 
        <!-- bold and red -->
        "What moves me so deeply, about the little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." 
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. </span>

        <span id = "second_underline">

        <!-- underline -->
        I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind... </span>
